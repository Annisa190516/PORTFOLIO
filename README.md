# PORTFOLIO
My personal Quality Assurance portfolio – test cases, bug reports, test plans, and QA projects.

👩🏻‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm Annisa Fitriani, a Quality Assurance with hands-on experience in manual testing, regression testing, UAT, bug reporting, and structured documentation.
I’m a detail-oriented tester who focuses on product stability, clarity of test scenarios, and delivering clean, reliable results before every release.
I enjoy breaking things (in a good way 😄) and helping teams ship features with confidence.
